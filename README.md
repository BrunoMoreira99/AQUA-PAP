AQUA is a **web platform** for programmers, whether they are students, teachers or professionals.

It consists of a platform with characteristics of a social network that allows its users to create *challenges*
that are later made available to all registered users who can then try to solve them.

AQUA is capable of receiving user submissions, evaluate them and determine whether or not these are correct.
